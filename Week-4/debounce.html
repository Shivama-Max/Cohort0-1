<!-- 
Without debouncing, every time a user types a character in either of the input fields, 
a request would be sent to the backend. This could lead to a high number of unnecessary
requests, especially if the user is typing continuously or making frequent adjustments.
This not only puts a strain on the server but can also lead to a poor user experience 
due to the constant processing and updating of data.
